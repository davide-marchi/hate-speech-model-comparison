MINI-PROJECT

Please implement the scenario below in the Python programming language with any additional packages or frameworks of your choice.

You can solve the problem as you wish, and choose the tools and approach yourself.

Task:
- Implement at least two classifiers of your choice 
- Measure both the effectiveness and efficiency of the classifiers and run a statistical test
- Analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of the classifiers (any error analysis of your choice)
- Reflect on how likely it is for this type of effectiveness and efficiency to be repeated on other data of the same domain or other classification models
- Write a short 1-2 page report on the above. The report can be in any format you choose.

Please email your code and report (in pdf) to all three of us no later than one week from receiving this. 

We ask you to conduct the task individually, without help from others and without supervision from us. Therefore, we will not answer any questions whatsoever on the mini-project.

Data:
Please use the Twitter Hate Speech dataset (only the training set) available at https://www.kaggle.com/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech.
